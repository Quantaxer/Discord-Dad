# Discord Friend
This is a simple bot for discord that I created. It runs asynchronously in a seperate python terminal that you can run. There are commands you can type in discord for it, and it will run them and display the result in your server.

## How to add to a discord server
1. First make sure you are logged into discord and have a server to add the bot
2. Go into the developer portal, OAuth2, select bot and go to the link provided. Bot set to private so it isn't added to servers by random people.

## How to run this bot
First of all you need to make sure the bot is added to your discord server. Make sure to refer to the note above. Once it is added, simply run *python commands.py* in a command prompt to begin the bot. It will send a message in the terminal once it is logged on. Planning on running this bot on a raspberry pi at some point
