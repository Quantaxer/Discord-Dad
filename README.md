# Discord Friend
This is a simple bot for discord that I created. It runs asynchronously in a seperate python terminal that you can run. There are commands you can type in discord for it, and it will run them and display the result in your server.

## How to add to a discord server

## How to run this bot
First of all you need to make sure the bot is added to your discord server. Make sure to refer to the note above. Once it is added, simply run *python commands.py* in a command prompt to begin the bot. It will send a message in the terminal once it is logged on.

## List of commands
No commands are set up at this time. Planned commands to implement include:
* ~help: Lists all available commands.
* ~pun: Tells a terrible, gut-wrenchingly bad joke.
* On message containing "I'm": the standard joke of 'Hi ____, I'm dad!'
* ~leave: The bot leaves the server to go get smokes at the convenience store, never to return again. Just like a true friend.
* ~colossal: Creates an absolute colossal mess in the chat. Not for the faint of heart.
* ~bruh: Initiates a bruh moment
* ~isBruh: Determines if something is in fact a bruh moment
* ~roast: Roasts the person who called this command. All in good fun.
* ~pasta: Inserts spaghetti into the chat (random copypasta)
* Some kind of error when no commands are found
